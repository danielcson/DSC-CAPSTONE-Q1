# Quarter 1 Capstone Project 
DSC180A Section A08: Imitating Behavior to Model the Brain

Due to issues with running the source code in the terminal on the UCSD Data Science & Machine Learning Platform (dsmlp), but no issues with a Jupyter notebook on dsmlp, run.ipynb is being used as a substitute for a run.py file. This repository can be run by cloning it to dsmlp then running run.ipynb. 

The goal for the project in section A08 for DSC180A was to replicate the figures from and build upon the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09451) "Deep Neuroethology of a Virtual Rodent" (Merel et al., 2019).
