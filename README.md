# Quarter 1 Capstone Project 
DSC180A Section A08: Imitating Behavior to Model the Brain

This model can be trained by calling train_cheetah.py along with pulling the dependencies in the Dockerfile to DSMLP, but that will take a few days to run. To get around this, the best way is to upload a pretrained model, but DSMLP does not support the file format and the file is too large to upload to Github. Due to these reasons, you can run this code on Google Colab by visiting this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TDih5q6UMmi-ZFNT5OzUmC6dySQOfhXo?usp=sharing).
