# Quarter 1 Capstone Project 
DSC180A Section A08: Imitating Behavior to Model the Brain

This model can be trained by calling train_cheetah.py, but that will take a few days to run. Best way is to upload a pretrained model, but DSMLP does not support the file format and the file is too large to upload to Github. Due to these reasons, the simplest way to run this code is on Google Colab by either uploading the repository and running 'run.ipynb' or visiting this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TDih5q6UMmi-ZFNT5OzUmC6dySQOfhXo?usp=sharing).
