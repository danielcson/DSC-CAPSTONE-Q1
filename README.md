# Exploring Neural Networks in Relation to Behavior
Q1 capstone project for DSC180A Section A08: Imitating Behavior to Model the Brain

Due to issues with running the source code in the terminal on the UCSD Data Science & Machine Learning Platform (dsmlp), but no issues with a Jupyter notebook on dsmlp, run.ipynb is being used as a substitute for a run.py file. This repository can be run by cloning it to dsmlp then running run.ipynb. 

No additional data needs to be downloaded to run the source code. To avoid having to spend a few days training the model, a pretrained model is provided and downloaded within the source code from this Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Xug1PoJ3bl3Ya9MTM0p-AR513mtsIVR/view)

The goal for this project is to replicate the figures from and build upon the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09451) "Deep Neuroethology of a Virtual Rodent" (Merel et al., 2019). The file run.ipynb outputs the key visualizations from the replication process and can also be found in the accompanying paper.
