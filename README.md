# Quarter 1 Capstone Project 
DSC180A Section A08: Imitating Behavior to Model the Brain

Due to issues with running the source code in the dsmlp terminal, but not Jupyter notebook, run.ipynb is being used as a substitute for a run.py file. This repository can be run by cloning it to dsmlp then running the cells in run.ipynb. 

The goal for the project in section A08 for DSC180A was to replicate the figures from and build upon the paper "Deep Neuroethology of a Virtual Rodent" (Merel et al., 2019).
